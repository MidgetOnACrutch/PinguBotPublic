##Setting up your new baby bot

First things first, Node.js
>This is REQUIRED or else nothing will work. [Link](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Next, coding enviroment if you dont have one already
>I highly suggest Visual Studio Code, compleatly free and very lightweight. [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Last step for code setup, installing discord.js
>Start by opening Visual Studio Code.
>Navigate to the fil button in the top left and click Open Folder. 
>Find the PinguBotPublic folder you should already have downloaded somewhere (if not do so now).
>This should open the folder into Visual Studio Code
>Still in Visual Studio Code, click View and click Integrated Terminal.
>Finally, in the Terminal that opened at the bottom type npm install discord.js and hit enter.
>Wait for it to download everything and your all done. Dont worry about any errors in the Terminal log, thats normal
